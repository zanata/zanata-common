msgid "The <firstterm>RPM Package Manager</firstterm> (RPM) is an open packaging system, which runs on &MAJOR_OS; as well as other Linux and UNIX systems. Red Hat, Inc. and the Fedora Project encourage other vendors to use RPM for their own products. RPM is distributed under the terms of the <firstterm>GPL</firstterm> (<firstterm>GNU General Public License</firstterm>)."

msgid "The RPM Package Manager only works with packages built to work with the <emphasis>RPM format</emphasis>. RPM is itself provided as a pre-installed rpm package. For the end user, RPM makes system updates easy. Installing, uninstalling and upgrading RPM packages can be accomplished with short commands. RPM maintains a database of installed packages and their files, so you can invoke powerful queries and verifications on your system. If you prefer a graphical interface, you can use the <application>PackageKit</application> GUI to perform many RPM commands. Refer to <xref linkend=\"ch-PackageKit\" /> for details."

When you get a new release of an operating system based on RPM, such as &MAJOR_OS;, you do not need to reinstall a fresh copy of the operating system your machine (as you might need to with operating systems based on other packaging systems). RPM allows intelligent, fully-automated, in-place upgrades of your system. In addition, configuration files in packages are preserved across upgrades, so you do not lose your customizations. There are no special upgrade files needed to upgrade a package because the same RPM file is used to both install and upgrade the package on your system."

With RPM, you have the pristine sources along with any patches that were used, plus complete build instructions. This is an important advantage for several reasons. For instance, if a new version of a program is released, you do not necessarily have to start from scratch to get it to compile. You can look at the patch to see what you <emphasis>might</emphasis> need to do. All the compiled-in defaults, and all of the changes that were made to get the software to build properly, are easily visible using this technique."
